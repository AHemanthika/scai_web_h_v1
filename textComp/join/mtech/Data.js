                        IIT Delhi senate has recently approved the MTech
                        programme in Machine Intelligence & Data Science (MINDS)
                        offered by ScAI. The MTech in MINDS will be a flagship
                        educational programme for the ScAI at IIT Delhi, and is
                        expected to begin in July 2022.

                    <p>
                        MTech in MINDS is planned as an industry-sponsored
                        programme. The students will be expected to work on
                        industry-relevant AI problems, since they will be
                        co-advised by an IIT Delhi faculty member and a
                        researcher from the sponsoring company. The MINDS
                        curriculum will include graduate-level courses in core
                        AI technologies like deep learning and data science,
                        application-oriented courses like computer vision and
                        natural language processing, and also fundamental
                        courses on mathematics underlying modern AI
                        technologies. The students who join the MINDS program
                        will have to complete a set of core courses, bridge core
                        courses, program electives, and a project. These courses
                        could be from course buckets such as mathematics,
                        learning, data science, and applications. Please check
                        back this space later for any updates.

                    degree (e.g., B.S. from a foreign university, and  M.Sc., MCA, or 
                    other Masterâ€™s degrees done as part of a 3+2 model) from any Engineering or Science discipline. 
                    A valid GATE score would be needed where such a requirement is not waived, such as students from 
                    an IIT with a CGPA exceeding a threshold. Strong interest and background in computational mathematics and programming are preferred.
