                    The robotics concentration within the School of AI aims at
                    addressing the scientific and technological challenges
                    permeating AI systems that involve interaction with the
                    physical world. On one hand, this field is concerned with
                    core principles of AI/ML systems governed by physical laws
                    (e.g.,nonlinear systems, physical interactions etc.). This
                    theme is relevant to understand physical phenomena that can
                    have a large impact on our society (e.g., climate,
                    biological interactions etc.). On the other hand, we seek to
                    develop AI/ML models for intelligent robotic systems that
                    can act and interact in the environment (e.g., robot
                    manipulators, soft robotic systems etc.). Here, the
                    challenges lie in the core areas of planning, perception,
                    NLP, reasoning & knowledge, control necessary for physical
                    robotic systems that display general-purpose intelligence,
                    particularly in domains cohabited with people. Collectively,
                    the aforementioned thrust aims at developing tools and
                    applications aimed towards the realization of intelligent
                    models and embodied systems capable of interacting with the
                    physical world. The investigation is inherently
                    multi-disciplinary in nature and assimilates tools from
                    various disciples and traditional departments, hence aligns
                    well with the vision of the School of AI.
