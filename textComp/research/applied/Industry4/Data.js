                The Fourth Industrial Revolution (or Industry 4.0) is the
                ongoing automation of traditional manufacturing and industrial
                practices. It majorly involves large-scale machine-to-machine
                communication and the internet of things (IoT) integrated for
                increased automation, improved communication and monitoring, and
                diagnosis without the need for human intervention. India as a
                country at the cusp of this transition.In the era of Industry
                4.0, it is envisaged that highly intelligent connected
                industrial systems create a fully digital value chain. On the
                one hand industrial operations are targeting for operational
                profits, on the other hand the operations should be safe,
                efficient and environmental benign.

                    The broad AI tools are employed for the deep learning, graph
                    mining, reinforcement learning, and surrogate models-based
                    optimization. Some of the key applications under
                    consideration are oil and gas, nuclear reactors and
                    industrial water networks.

                    <p>
                        Digital twin is an integrated multi-physics,
                        multi-scale, data driven models that enables simulation
                        of a system and uses the best available physical models,
                        sensor updates, etc. It is the AI driven replica of the
                        process that leverage full strength of archived sensor
                        data. However, a key technical challenge here is the
                        variety of the data, which may be discrete, continuous,
                        sequential.

                    <p>
                        Here, we employ previously developed digital twins for
                        AI-driven optimal decision making for improving the
                        efficiency, and de-bottlenecking the operation. A key
                        proposal here to factor in the sustainability to be
                        factored in accounting for less wastage (lean
                        production), less emissions (green production). To
                        achieve this we envisage to solve a multi-objective
                        optimization problem honouring various constraints.

                    <li>Anomaly Detection</li>
                    <p>
                        This ensures AI-driven guidance for safe operation
                        employing digital twins. Here, the digital twin model
                        serves as the null model. We are intended to identify
                        anomalous signatures much before a potential event that
                        is a potential manifestation of the networked effect of
                        sub-components. Causal inference between multiple
                        sub-units will also be evaluated. This step will aid in
                        the sensor network design or retrofitting for efficient
                        information processing.
